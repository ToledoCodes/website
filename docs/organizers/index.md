      <span class="organizer-name"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashrajmote/" target="_blank">Yashraj Mote</a></span> - <span class="pronouns">he/him</span> - I'm a recent Computer Science Engineering graduate from the University of Toledo and currently working on an early-stage startup through the UToledo Business Incubator. My work spans full-stack development, AI/ML, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps — and I've had the chance to build production systems at companies like Crown Equipment and Abhitech Energycon. I believe Toledo has untapped potential as a tech hub, and I'm passionate about building bridges between students and the local tech ecosystem.
