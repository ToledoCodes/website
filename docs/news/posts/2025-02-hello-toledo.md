# Hello, Toledo

Hey, Toledo tech community! 🚀

Toledo Codes is officially launching, and we couldn’t be more excited. Whether you’re a seasoned developer, an aspiring coder, a designer, or just someone who loves tech, we’re building a space for you.

Join Us for the First Toledo Codes Meetup

📅 March 20, 2025
⏰ 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM
📍 Toledo Tech Loft - 336 N. Superior St, Toledo, OH 43604

This is your chance to be part of something new—Toledo’s own developer community, focused on fostering collaboration, learning, and innovation.

At this first event, we’ll dive into Augmented Development, exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) can transform the way we code. Justin Beaudry will guide us through practical ways to supercharge your workflow with AI, helping you write better code, debug faster, and build smarter.

But this isn’t just a talk—it’s an opportunity to connect, share ideas, and shape the future of Toledo Codes. Expect great conversations, networking, and a look at what’s ahead for our community.

Why You Should Come
 • Learn how to level up your development skills with AI.
 • Connect with other tech enthusiasts in Toledo.
 • Get in on the ground floor of a new, growing community.

We’re just getting started, and we want you to be part of it. See you there!
